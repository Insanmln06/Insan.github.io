The first time I first tried Linux was when I was in junior high school. 
At that time the reason I wanted to try Linux was my interest in Metasploit. 
Therefore, the first Linux I tried was Kali Linux, dual booting with Windows 7.

But my first experience installing linux is arguably quite pait the article that my initial intention was to do dual os linux with windows instead ended up failing and my hard disk data was also formatted instead. 
It is quite paiting, but I do not dissolve in sadness, 
because most of the data on my hard disk only contains the contents of the Game and Anime.

Even though my first experience was quite relevant, 
it didn't make me give up and I went back to try installing again and learn from the first experience. 
I became more thorough when I tried installing Linux a second time. 
After following the tutorial in full, I finally succeeded in installing Linux for the first time. 
It felt like there was a special satisfaction at that time.

Using linux Turns out it's not as easy as imagined, the first problem I faced was an undetected Wireless driver. 
Already trying to find solutions here and there but there is no solution. 
Understandably, still a beginner on Linux, can directly have problems in WiFi. 
Finally I gave up. Only 3 days using Linux times, I returned to Windows again. 
I deleted the Linux partition. A week later I tried installing another distro, Ubuntu. 
But only using Ubuntu is not more than 2 weeks, because I feel this distribution is too heavy to run on my laptop. 
Understandably I did not know much about the desktop environment at that time I used ubuntu with a desktop environment underneath it was Gnome which was quite heavy for laptops with exact specifications.

From here I finally tried Manjaro Linux. 
Manjaro Linux is a derivative of Arch Linux, which utilizes the Xfce desktop environment, rolling release model, and Pacman package manager. 
but the problem is the same as when using Linux times,
It took a long time to use this distribution to be my leptop default operating system.
As long as I use the manjaro distro, it also doesn't run smoothly, sometimes I find errors when I try to install an application package, but this problem doesn't make me give up because actually, the challenges when overcoming the existing problems is what makes using the Linux OS attractive to me.

Until now, I still use Manjaro Linux. For desktop environments, you will often change, starting from gnome classic, cinnamon, mate, etc.
From the writing above it can be concluded that maybe we did not immediately succeed when trying new things. may even face disaster. For example the wrong set of partitions that cause all files to disappear. But with that we have experience in the future.
